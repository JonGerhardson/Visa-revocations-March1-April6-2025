# Visa-revocations-March1-April6-2025

DISCLAIMER: This is just intended as a temporary reference and github is the easiest way to publish a markdown table online. That said, please feel welcome to submit pull requests with updates or corrections. This information is moderately accurate as of April 7. It was AI generated, **do not** cite it as a source. 

The schools below are from the list of 60 schools the Department of Education said were under investigation for antisemitism in a March 10 press release, and another 50 schools pulled from a Reddit thread about the recent visa cancellations. State school systems include each indivisual school. This information is based only on existing news articles published between March 1 and April 6, 2025. 

Lisence: You may reproduce this table in part or entirely and remix it etc. as you might if it was licensed under CC4.0 EXCEPT you MUST include the disclaimer above, and must license it under this same license.
Okay, here is the information from the previous consolidated report formatted into a data table (using Markdown).

**Updates April 7** 

Now using only initials for affected individuals and only if those names have been widely reported elsewhere. Stylized in lower case (j.g.) to avoid confusion with acronyms of schools/agencies. Doing this for both privacy and character count reasons. 

Began adding info about detentions. Format will be "x (y detained)" for right now. Not yet complete. 

Manually verified information. I did not find any innacuracies. If I find wrong info I will make a  note of it,here. For newly added information, as opposed to wrong information that's been corrected, see git commit logs. 

Leaving generated disclaimer for the time being in case I missed something. 

TO DO:
- Link two sources for schools which only have one
 - Possibly add column about for visa revocations that are known to be related to political views (?)
- Check to see if any schools not listed here have reported visa revocations. 


Please email me if you're aware of any new info, or think I missed something or would like to contribute. jon.gerhardson at proton.me
