# Visa-revocations-March1-April6-2025

DISCLAIMER: This is just intended as a temporary reference and github is the easiest way to publish a markdown table online. That said, please feel welcome to submit pull requests with updates or corrections. This information is moderately accurate as of April 7. It was AI generated, **do not** cite it as a source. 

The schools below are from the list of 60 schools the Department of Education said were under investigation for antisemitism in a March 10 press release, and another 50 schools pulled from a Reddit thread about the recent visa cancellations. State school systems include each individual school. This information is based only on existing news articles published between March 1 and April 6, 2025. 

Lisence: You may reproduce this table in part or entirely and remix it etc. as you might if it was licensed under CC4.0 EXCEPT you MUST include the disclaimer above, and must license it under this same license.

**Updates April 7** 

Now using only initials for affected individuals and only if those names have been widely reported elsewhere. Stylized in lower case (j.g.) to avoid confusion with acronyms of schools/agencies. Doing this for both privacy and character count reasons. 

Began adding info about detentions. Format will be "x (y detained)" for right now. Not yet complete. 

I am not adding new schools at this time that have declined comment, but am adding schools that have affirmitively stated there have been no cancelled visas, along with the date of that claim. 

Manually verified information. I did not find any innacuracies. If I find wrong info I will make a  note of it,here. For newly added information, as opposed to wrong information that's been corrected, see git commit logs. 

Leaving generated disclaimer for the time being in case I missed something. 

****Tracking visa statuses, etc. for non-students is important, but out of scope for this project because I am not currently aware of a good way to go about doing that. ****

TO DO:
- Link two sources for schools which only have one. Ideally one is a press release from school, other is reeputable news source. 
 - Possibly add column about for visa revocations that are known to be related to political views (?)
 - More state schools need to be added
- Find a better way to compile and update this info sso it can be updated daily as more details become available 
  
April 7 @19:51 EDT - Changed UC San Diego from "5+ (1 detained)" to "6 (1 Deported)" added an additional source

Please email me if you're aware of any new info, or think I missed something or would like to contribute. jon.gerhardson at proton.me
